# Portfolio Website

This is my web design portfolio, originally created as part of a project at my time at The Iron Yard.

My portfolio is constantly evolving as my code skills and design knowledge gets better, so what you see is a good representation of where I am in my skillset. I used HTML, CSS with Sass and some help from bourbon, and then some Javascript and jQuery for interaction. 

The photography on the site is done by both myself and Justin Nix, and all fonts are hosted from Adobe Typekit.
